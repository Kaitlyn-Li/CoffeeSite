This repo contains the website pages that I created for a local coffeeshop that also sells their coffee beans online. This website by no means is the completed version but rather the skeleton of what the final product should look like. Website contains multiple pages including home page, about page, menu page, product page, review page, contact page as well as a page for blogs to be posted. Website is fully respoinsive that works well for different screen sizes and devices. 

## How It's Made: 

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations: 

In time, I will be adding some backend to this website to contain customer login where customer will be able to create an account, log in, purchase products offered by the coffeeshop and check out. A reservation section might seem like a good idea as well although I will have to communicate with the coffeeshop owner to see if he would like to include a reservation system. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that in order to not overwhelm myself and be intimidated by projects with multiple moving parts as well as layers of complexities, it's better to tackle it by breaking the project down intow smaller, manageable chucks and go from there.
